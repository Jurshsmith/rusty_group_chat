# Rusty Group Chat

Group chats from your terminal. Built with Rust 🦀

## How It Works

- Clone this Repo
- Add a `.env` file using `.env.sample`'s template
- Serve `rusty_group_chat_web` locally using: `cargo run --bin rusty_group_chat_web`
- Ask your friends to also clone this repo and share the group chat endpoint/link.
- Alternatively, you could use: [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) to expose the group chat
  endpoint outside your local network and share that instead.
- Run the `cargo run --bin rusty_group_chat_cli` and follow the prompts to begin chatting. Your friends
  will need to do same. Happy chatting! 👩🏿‍💻 🧑🏿‍💻

### FEATURE TODOs

- Allow user try another user name if it's already taken
- Add text colors for personalizing chat messages per user
- Escape to quit terminal
- Indicate when users are typing
- Read receipt

_PS: Feel free to open issues_ ;)
